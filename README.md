# 🧠 Child Mental Health Diagnostic Game

**CognitiveCatch: An Interactive Laravel Web App for Early Detection of Cognitive and Mental Disorders in Children through Gamified Assessment.**

This project was developed as part of my **Master’s thesis** at **Sapienza University of Rome**, completed in **October 2023**. The platform combines advanced technology with psychological insights to create a child-friendly diagnostic tool.

## 📘 Project Overview

This platform provides an interactive, online environment where children engage with tests based on:
- 🎨 **Color recognition**
- 🔢 **Number sequences**
- 🔺 **Shape identification**

Alongside the game, behavioral data and a follow-up questionnaire are used to **identify patterns** and **support preliminary diagnosis** of conditions like ADHD, ASD, and learning disabilities.

The system was developed with guidance from both the **Faculty of Computer Engineering** and the **Faculty of Psychology**, blending technical innovation with clinical insight.
